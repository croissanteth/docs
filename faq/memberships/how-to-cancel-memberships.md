# ‚ùå How to cancel memberships?

This interface allows any BakeryNFT owner to update elements of the NFT they manage.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/1 (6).png>)

In the block explorer, you'll find "`expireAndRefundFor`". The "`_keyOwner (address)"` field is where you enter the wallet address of the person with the key/ membership you would like to make expire. The `amount` field is the amount of the refund, based on the currency it is priced in. By inputting 0, there will be no refund.

By updating this field, the key owner will still technically have the NFT, but it will be expired, thus ending the membership and all of its goodness.
