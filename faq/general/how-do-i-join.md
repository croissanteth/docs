# ðŸ“© How do I join?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

There are many ways you can join the BakeryDAO, including by following through with the steps after clicking [this link](https://bakerydao.me/website).

A member of the BakeryDAO is someone holding either the BakeryNFT (which is not expired), or the BakeryDAO token, which is **not** live yet.

However, while scrolling through the Bakery website, you may also find that a number of articles have a paywall behind them, with the full articles only available to holders of the Bakery NFT. There are also ways to join spread across the [whole website](https://pastry.xyz).
