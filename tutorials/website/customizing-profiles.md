# ðŸ‘½ Customizing profiles

Want to start customizing profiles for the BakeryDAO? Once you visit a page on the BakeryDAO website that's locked to only members of the Bakery NFT, you will be able to login with your Ethereum wallet by clicking the login button at the top of the article.

The login buttons are located in numerous places across the site, but if you're ever unsure of where to find them, just head over to the Chef's Menu section of the page. All articles in this category have a login button placed conveniently at the top.

Upon clicking login you will be temporarily redirected to a login page, where you can login with your email address, username, or Ethereum address. When you connect your Ethereum wallet here, you may be asked to sign a transaction if you are a first time user. This does not incur gas fees, and on the back-end creates an account on the site for your wallet.

After connecting to your Ethereum wallet from the screen, if you are a holder of the BakeryNFT, you will be see a page that looks something like this, where you can begin editing or customizing your profile:

This is where you can customize your account for the BakeryDAO, and change how it appears when you interact with the community.

Hover over the top right navigation section of the toolbar, and select "Edit Profile" to customize your account for the BakeryDAO. You will be sent to this page where you can update customization settings, your displayed profile picture, and many other things displayed on your account.
