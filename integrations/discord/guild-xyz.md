# 🏫 Guild xyz



* **Option 1:** Join button Whenever you create a new role in your guild the bot automatically posts a _Join ‘guild name’_ button in the channel you chose for the first point of entry for users. This button leads to authentication on your guild page. You can delete this button if you’d rather use an other method or want the button elsewhere. To insert the button in a different channel you have to type: _/join-button_ into the chat of that channel and the bot will insert the button there.
* **Option 2:** Sharing a link Sharing the link to your guild page with your users on any social platforms, privately in messages or publicly in your bio. If you use Discord with your community it will look like this: a pinned link into a channel in your server that leads to your guild page. Here members have to click one _Join guild_ button to access all levels (roles) they are eligible for, sign a message and done.
* **Option 3:** !join command Users type in !join command into ANY channel in your server where they will see a private post by our bot(not DM but its only that one user who sees this in response to their command) with a button to authenticate on the guild page and boom, done.
