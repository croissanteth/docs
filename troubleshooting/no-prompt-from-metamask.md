# ðŸ¦Š No prompt from Metamask!

This is typically an error when the user does not have enough gas to cover the transaction on the wallet, thus MetaMask won't send a prompt to the user. Wait until gas fees go down and try again, or just buy the [BakeryNFTs on Optimism](../faq/purchasing/how-to-purchase-on-optimism.md)!
