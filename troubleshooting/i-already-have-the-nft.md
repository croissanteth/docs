# ðŸ—£ I already have the NFT!

The applications will not prompt you to buy a second BakeryNFT, it just needs to connect to your address to know which NFT you have. Select the NFT you've already purchased, then proceed from there where necessary!

If you're still having issues, your NFT may be expired. Try renewing it by following the instructions [here](../faq/memberships/how-to-renew-memberships.md)...
