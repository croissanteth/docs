# Making A Post

The use cases for Pastry NFTs span far and wide. These baked goods enable members of the BakeryDAO to perform a variety of actions across platforms and [https://pastry.xyz/](https://pastry.xyz). One of which is making and publishing their own content onto a members portal within the website.

Posts made by Pastries will be displayed under the "Community" section, and are only accessible to members of the BakeryDAO.

In order to make a post, head to [https://pastry.xyz/](https://pastry.xyz).

Once you're there, click "LOGIN" in the top right corner.

You will be prompted to sign a message in Metamask to verify ownership of your wallet.

After you sign the message, you will see a page that looks like this:

Click on the network in which your Pastry NFT resides, and you will see a page saying that you have a valid membership along with a button that will redirect you back to the BakeryDAO website.

When you're back on the site, the "LOGIN" button will be replaced with a profile picture that is associated with your Ethereum address.

If you click on it, you will see a dropdown window appear with options for customization.

To make a post, we will be clicking on the "My blogs" button.

After clicking on "My blogs", it will look like this:

Click "Create new Blog", and a template for making an article will appear.

Within this template, there are four sections that will allow for customization of your article: "Upload Image", "Title...", a block for text, and "Enter tags".

The image you upload for the first section is what will be displayed alongside your title on the website. The "Title..." field is where the name of your article will go.

Under title, there is a space for text where you will place the entirety of your article in.

Lastly, there is an option to add tags to the post. Tags are essentially a way to place your article within a specific category on the website, so you will want to make sure you pick ones that are relevant to your article.

Depending on what you choose, your article will appear under the category for the tag specified on the website.

For this example, I will be making a post with the title "testing the features...", "cooking..." for the article text, and "Chef's Menu" and "Bitcoin" for the tags.

After you have tailored the contents of your article to your liking, click "Create" at the bottom of the screen.

Your post will then appear under "My blogs" on your profile, and provide you with a preview of what it looks like.
