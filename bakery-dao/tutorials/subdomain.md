# ðŸª… SUBDOMAIN

A personalized subdomain just for pastries. This is where your own posts and contributions will appear for the Bakery, if you're looking for a pretty URL and some nice benefits added on top of it. Furthermore, our unique deployment allows this subdomain to act as your own Ethereum wallet, completely out of our control!

You can register it for free and resolve it to the address of your choosing, to begin receiving ETH and other tokens to username.bakerydao.eth.

Furthermore, each registration comes with an ERC-721 minted to the purchasing address, which acts as a membership itself.

First, find the register function after following this link (function #2): [https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d3a1bcb82db7a977e0b0dabb192862c2dd027d5#writeContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d3a1bcb82db7a977e0b0dabb192862c2dd027d5#writeContract)&#x20;

Next, insert the ENS name you wish to claim in the format of the example provided below. After clicking "write" and confirming the transaction in your wallet, the new ENS name will be owned by your address!&#x20;

To have it appear elsewhere as your web3 username (+ bonus points), visit:

&#x20;[https://app.ens.domains/address/](https://app.ens.domains/address/)\<your-address-here>

You will see a dropdown to select the new username you just acquired. Select it + hit save, then confirm the transaction in your wallet.
