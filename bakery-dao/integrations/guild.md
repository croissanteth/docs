If you already have a Bakery DAO membership, click in the top right where it says "Connect to a wallet".

From there, you will be asked to connect the wallet. Once connected, it will automatically detect which Bakery DAO membership you have and grant you roles accordingly.

Come join us and the growing list of guild members looking to explore the possibilities of Web3!
