Get started with [The Bake Community](https://bake.community) on Discourse! This is the main spot for discussing what's new in the ecosystem regarding proposals, governance, development, and partnerships! As a first time visitor, the page will look something like this...

In the top right corner, you‚Äôll see options to login or sign up for the site to begin posting. Sign up here or login to your existing discourse account to continue.

Once logged in or signed up for your account on Discourse, navigate to one of the locked categories or topics. If you are already a holder of a valid Pastry NFT, content will immediately be available for viewing. However, if you are not a member the topics will be hidden behind the Pastry NFT.

![Connect Wallet Page](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1).png>)

From here, connect to you Ethereum wallet and continue with the purchase of the Pastry NFT in your wallet.
