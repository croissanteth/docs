# üç∞ PASTRY XYZ

The Bakery DAO website, [https://pastry.xyz/](https://pastry.xyz) is the premier product of the Bakery DAO. Using the unique features of NFTs, we have created a token gated research hub where only the best alpha is accessible to the community (Pastry NFT holders).

Sounds simple on the surface, right?&#x20;

Let's dive into the underlying functions to see what's going on under the hood... When users enter the [https://pastry.xyz/](https://pastry.xyz) website, they will see the following page:

Users who are not yet members are able to freely browse the content under "Home" "Blog", "About", and "Pricing".

However, if you wish view more in-depth and tasty alpha, you will need to obtain access to the **Research** column.

Under this section, a brief introduction of research articles will be shown. However, it is not shown in its entirety...

When someone who is not a member goes to click on one of these articles, they will be prompted verify their Bakery NFT membership.

Behind the scenes, this content is hidden behind a lock, which is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.&#x20;

The Bakery uses [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) compliant contracts capable of creating and managing NFTs (non-fungible tokens called "Keys"), as well as restricting access based on the user's possession (or lack of) one of these keys.
